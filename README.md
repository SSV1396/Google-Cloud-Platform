# Google-Cloud-Platform
## Google Cloud Project Description 
This project focusses on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Google Cloud storage where Pub/Sub is a messaging service offered by Google Cloud Platform that enables real-time communication between independent applications and Google Cloud Storage, on the other hand, is a cloud-based storage solution that allows businesses to store and manage large amounts of data in the cloud. Together, Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Google Cloud Storage can provide businesses with a powerful solution for managing and processing data in real-time.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services provided by Google that allows businesses and developers to build, deploy, and manage their applications and services in the cloud. GCP provides a wide range of infrastructure, platform, and software services, including computing, storage, networking, data analytics, machine learning, security, and developer tools.
 
The two services in GCP are google cloud pubsub and google cloud storage.

GOOGLE PUBSUB:
Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service provided by Google Cloud Platform that enables asynchronous messaging between different applications or services. Pub/Sub provides a scalable and flexible messaging infrastructure that can be used for event-driven computing, streaming analytics, and real-time data processing.
